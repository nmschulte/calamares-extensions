calamares-settings-mobian (0.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ undef ]
  * d/control: Remove unnecessary dependencies.
  * Rebase package to calamares-extensions upstream
  * d/patches: update module patch for new upstream.
    Changes are now rebased on current calamares-extensions, which required
    minor modifications to the module patch.
  * d/* reshuffle file locations for more efficient install
    d/branding created to contain a mobian branding rather than patching
     the default-mobile branding. Note, this is still installed as default-mobile
     as the mobile module's QML hard-codes this name.
    d/config moved module config to d/config/modules and fixed relevant install line.
    d/control remove superfluous quilt build-depend.
    d/patches Remove branding (see d/branding) and limit-modules patch.
     The latter was unnecessary.
    d/calamares-settings-mobian.service renamed to automate install.
  * d/copyright correct upstream contributors.
    Previous changelog was taken from osk-sdl. This one matches
    calamares-extensions.
  * d/patches add wait-time-wording patch.
    Fixes the wording of wait.qml to ensure users don't believe the installer
    has hung.
  * d/copyright fix source URL.
    Source URL should point to upstream source, not package VCS.

  * debian: don't install default branding.
    This would cause conflicts with `calamares` which installs the same
    files.
  * debian: don't use dh-exec.
    Current debhelper seems to not need it.
  * d/patches: remove PartitionJob patch
  * calamares-install-bootloader: use correct luks volume name.
    The encrypted partition label is now `calamares_crypt` due to upstream
    changes, let's use it for our crypttab setup.
