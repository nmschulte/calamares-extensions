  [ undef ]
  * split calamares-extensions from calamares-settings-mobian
  * New upstream release
  * Remove wait-time patch (included in upstream)
  * d/control: Add filesystem tools as runtime dependencies.

  * d/copyright: fix file location
  * d/control: add myself as Uploaders
  * d/gbp.conf: fix upstream tag format
