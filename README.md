# Calamares Branding Examples

> A *branding component* in Calamares is a QML "slideshow" that is
> displayed during the installation phase of Calamares -- while it is
> doing things to the target system. The component also provides
> the names and descriptions of the product (i.e. distribution)
> being installed.

This repository contains complete examples of branding for Calamares.
Calamares ships with (just) one default branding component which
can be used for testing. The examples here show what can be done
with QML in the context of Calamares branding, and provide examples
and documentation for the framework that Calamares ships with.

 - `default/` is a copy of the default branding that is included with Calamares
 - `fancy/` has navigation buttons and a slide counter
 - `samegame/` is a copy of the Qt Company "Same Game" QML demo. It
   shows that **any** QML can be used for branding purposes.
